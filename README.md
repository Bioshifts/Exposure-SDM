This repository contains code to:
1) Download global climate data from terrestrial and marine environments
2) Calculate climate change velocities at each study area from the studies included in the Bioshifts database
3) Fit species distribution models for species present at the Bioshifts database
4) Calculate species range shifts
5) Compare estimated species range shifts with observed range shifts documented in the Bioshifts database
